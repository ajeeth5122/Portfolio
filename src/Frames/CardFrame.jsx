            <p>Hi there! I'm a passionate and curious frontend developer with a growing love for building clean, user-friendly web interfaces. My journey began with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've recently been diving into React.js and Flutter to expand my skills across both web and mobile platforms. </p>
            <p>I enjoy turning ideas into interactive experiences — whether it's a simple to-do list app or a job portal UI. I learn best through hands-on projects, clear documentation, and feedback that helps me improve. Every line of code I write is a step forward in mastering the craft.
